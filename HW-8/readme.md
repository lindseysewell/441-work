#Hw-8

I don't really know how I feel about this project. The process that I went through for this involved a lot of confusion, but it actually turned out much more simple than I had originally thought it would be. I used my own art for this project, and I'm not sure if i love the look that came from it. I'm okay with the haikus, but I don't know about hte overall aesthetic. I may make some changes to this project at some point before I can be satisfied with it.
