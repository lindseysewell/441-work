# Week 1 Homework

This assignment was a bit daunting at first. My last web design class was about a year ago, and though I understood most of the basics, I didn't remember a lot of the thing's I'd learned. However, after some studying and practice, I think I created some semblance of a functional web page. My favorite part was the stylesheet. I especially like the parallax scrolling. It's a nice finishing touch. I had some trouble loading my hero image because of the image size, which caused a bit of anxiety while i figured it out.

Overall, I think this project was quite successful. I'm excited to see where this course takes me.
