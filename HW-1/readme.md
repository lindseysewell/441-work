# Week 1 Homework

This assignment was a bit daunting at first. My last web design class was about a year ago, and though I understood most of the basics, I didn't remember a lot of the thing's I'd learned. However, after some studying and practice, I think I created some semblance of a functional web page. My favorite part was the stylesheet.

Overall, I think this project was mostly successful. I especially like the parallax scrolling. It's a nice finishing touch.
