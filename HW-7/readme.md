# HW-7

This week's assignment was surprisingly difficult. There were many broken versions of this assignment. I'm excited to show off some of my photography. This project took about 4 evenings of work, and I'm relieved to finally get it done.

Issues:
- creating new objects
- making randomNumber variable
- order and clarity of code

I like the outcome of my project for assignment 7.
